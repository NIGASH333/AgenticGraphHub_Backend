Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) - Full Overview
======================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)
------------------------------------------------
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines
that are designed to think and act like humans. AI enables machines to perform tasks
that typically require human intelligence such as reasoning, problem-solving, learning,
perception, and understanding language.

AI is used in various fields like healthcare, finance, education, marketing, cybersecurity,
and robotics. Its ultimate goal is to create systems that can function autonomously and
make intelligent decisions without human intervention.

2. TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
-----------------------------------
AI can be categorized based on capability and functionality.

A. Based on Capability:
   1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** Specialized in one task (e.g., virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa).
   2. **General AI (Strong AI):** Can perform any intellectual task that a human can.
   3. **Super AI:** Surpasses human intelligence (currently theoretical).

B. Based on Functionality:
   1. **Reactive Machines:** No memory; reacts to specific inputs (e.g., IBM’s Deep Blue).
   2. **Limited Memory:** Can learn from past experiences (e.g., self-driving cars).
   3. **Theory of Mind:** Machines understand emotions and human needs (in development).
   4. **Self-aware AI:** Machines with consciousness and awareness (still hypothetical).

3. MACHINE LEARNING (ML)
------------------------
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience
without being explicitly programmed. ML uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make
predictions or decisions.

For example, ML powers spam email filters, recommendation systems (like Netflix), and credit
fraud detection systems.

4. TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING
-----------------------------
1. **Supervised Learning:**
   - The model is trained on labeled data (input and output are known).
   - Example algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM.
   - Applications: Spam detection, price prediction.

2. **Unsupervised Learning:**
   - The model learns from unlabeled data (output not provided).
   - Example algorithms: K-Means Clustering, PCA, Association Rules.
   - Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

3. **Semi-supervised Learning:**
   - Combination of labeled and unlabeled data.
   - Used when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

4. **Reinforcement Learning:**
   - The model learns by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
   - Example: AlphaGo, self-driving cars, robotics control.

5. DEEP LEARNING (DL)
----------------------
Deep Learning is a specialized branch of ML inspired by the human brain’s structure — neural networks.
It uses multiple layers of artificial neurons to process large amounts of data and extract complex patterns.

- Common Architectures:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – for image recognition.
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – for sequential data like speech and text.
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) – for generating synthetic data.
